# Wrangling & Exploratory Analysis

Data seldom arrives ready for modeling.  This lecture dives into the *tidy data* principles—each variable forming a column and each observation a row—that make analysis tractable.  Students learn to examine schemas and data dictionaries, handle missingness (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), detect and correct outliers, and convert types and units consistently.

Practical instruction with pandas covers joins (inner, outer, left, right), merges across multiple tables, and reshaping data with `melt` and `pivot`.  We emphasize writing reusable cleaning functions and logging transformations.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) follows: visualizing distributions via histograms and boxplots, exploring relationships through scatter matrices and pair plots, and assessing correlation structures with heatmaps.  EDA is framed as an iterative, question‑driven process that generates hypotheses for modeling.
